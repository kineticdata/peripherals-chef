=== Detailed Description
  To add an attribute to an existing Chef Server node, the handler uses Chef's
  REST API. The handler first retrieves the users private key from the specified
  location so that it can then be used to sign the REST request. The handler
  then retrieves the node that will be updated to get all of the attributes that 
  are currently attached to it. The inputted Attribute Name and Attribute Value
  will then be added as a key/value pair to the 'normal' attribute object in the
  node object. That updated object is then re-posted to the Chef Server to apply
  the changes to the node attributes on the Chef Server. And errors that are
  encountered during the process are caught and re-rasied by the handler.
