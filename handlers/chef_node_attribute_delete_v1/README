=== Detailed Description
  To delete an attribute from an existing Chef Server node, the handler uses
  Chef's REST API. The handler first retrieves the users private key from the 
  specified location so that it can then be used to sign the REST request. The
  handler then retrieves the node that will be updated to get all of the
  attributes that are currently attached to it, looks for a 'normal' attribute
  key that matches the Attribute Name parameter and deletes it from the object.
  The updated node object is then re-posted to the Chef Server to apply the
  changes to the node attributes on the Chef Server. And errors that are
  encountered during the process are caught and re-rasied by the handler.
